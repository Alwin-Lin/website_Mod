Before we get into the details, big thanks to all the speakers for coming to the code lab, what you presented goes a long way in shaping the future of the attending students, even if they chose not to go into tech.

Special thanks to Sam Lin for contacting the speakers and giving advice throughout the 4-week journey.

Lastly thanks to all the students that attended and gave feedback on what to improve in the code lab, this project is far from perfect, but with your help, we are one step closer.
 
Week two is all about setting up a virtual machine on the Google Cloud Platform. We kick off with guest speaker Yahan Zhou, sharing his progress of starting in tech, as well as some insights regarding the previously emerging market of GPU.
Afterward, transitioned into one of the most chaotic code labs up to date. Apparently, being a teacher isn't about looking at the material and reciting everything word by word like a robot. It's a shame that past me didn't fully understand that and went on to impersonate a drunk text-to-speech program on steroids.
