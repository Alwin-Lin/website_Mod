Last but definitely not least, coming in week 4, we have Ying Qi to talk a bit about starting a career in CS despite previously studying in a different major, alongside some pointers for who wishes to become an international student one day. 
Having known how to set up a virtual machine on the Google cloud platform and the components that go into building a functional Android system, the last week was dedicated to using all that we have learned and making a custom Android development environment as well as tweaking the Android system.
Doing so allows the students to take on projects on their own in the future, knowing how to create a VM that is tailored to their needs, as well as how to package and distribute the machine image to others in their team.
