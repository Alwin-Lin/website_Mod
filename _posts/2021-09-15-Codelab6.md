Long have we waited, but it's finally happening.

Starting on 10/15 we will have our first series of code labs that aims to introduce high school students to cloud computing, inspiring more students to pursue computer science as their major later in their lives.

Don't worry, we will be rolling out another set of courses fairly soon, stay tuned.

If you wish to take a look at the materials, here is the GitHub link:
