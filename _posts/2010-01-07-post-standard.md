Week 3, we are joined with guest speaker Agatha Man, talking briefly about getting into tech, sharing advice on planning and preparing for interviews in big tech. 
Headed into the code lab, having learned the lesson from the previous week, the pace was a lot more mellow. We went over the few major questions collected from the previous week, patched up a few issues that have been bothering the students, and into the main topic.
This week is centered around how source control works and the process of building an Android system. This was also the week that we received most questions out of the 4, partially because the foundation laying at week 2 wasn’t as solid as one would wish, and partially because this is one of the more content-dense weeks out of the 4.
