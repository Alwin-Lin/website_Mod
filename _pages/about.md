## Our story
Computer Science for Equity & Beyond (CSEB) was founded April 2021 by Alwin Lin after seeing the impact that COVID had on work space. Leveraging the power of cloud computing, we are able to allow anyone who has a computer and a wifi connection to join in and learn about computer science.
